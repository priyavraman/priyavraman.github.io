I specialize in South Asian classical and folk dance theatre and have been a performer, educator, and writer for two decades. I debuted as a performer in 1997, in my hometown, Bangalore. My performing years as a teenager were fostered by the 1990s competition culture, nothing like the millennial toxic competition format of popular media. These competitions, hosted by modest local cultural groups promoted and motivated dancers through exposure to public performance. Participating in these competitions helped attune me to the evolving dance aesthetic, and helped frame collective identities with the dance community and my contemporaries, a camaraderie I continue to share. Achievements at regional and national levels through these platforms laid a strong foundation for my career as a performer. 
I create interdisciplinary productions that blend elements of Indian classical dance with poetry, literature, mythology, and cultural aesthetics. I use the gesture, mime, and rhythm techniques in performance to anchor social dialogue and emphasize the capacity of art to weave communal compassion. These experiences have allowed me to educate global audiences on the diverse Indian socio-cultural landscape through the medium of expression.

As a **critic**, I engage in embodied spectatorship and writing. My writing is a personalized narrative that allows me to share the experiential aspects of culture, performance, and artistic creations. I reflect on art through embodied memory and nostalgia and invite my audiences to a communal and empathetic consumption. In my writing, I incorporate humor, suggestion, and sensory imagery to create texts that serve as both archival records and practical resources for artists and audiences alike.

My columns and commentaries published in print and online media documented trends in performance. For my eZine â€“ _The Kalaparva_, I developed and managed regular content which included curating a diverse range of materials such as performance previews, reviews, travel narratives, feature articles, interviews, and news updates focused on South Asian arts. I also encouraged and welcomed contributions from volunteers.
