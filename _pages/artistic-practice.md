I am trained in the South Indian classical dance style of Bharatanatyam and have been a performer, educator, and writer for three decades. In my career as a performer, I have been invited to present at several Government and private cultural events and have conceived innovative productions that combined the Indian classical dance vocabulary with poetry, literature, myth, and cultural aesthetics. I was selected by the Rotary International as a cultural ambassador to tour Illinois and present illustrated lectures on Indian dance. In my school of Bharatanatyam, I taught students in the traditional guru-sishya parampara training system and presented students in performances. I collaborated with cultural organizations and school administrations to design and conduct interactive dance workshops in primary and secondary schools in several Indian cities and trained and motivated teachers to inculcate performing arts in the school curriculum. As a dance writer, I volunteered with print and online portals contributing columns and commentaries on Indian dance. Between 2011-2016 I ran my eZine â€“ The Kalaparva which carried performance previews, reviews, travelogues, feature articles, interviews, and news feed on Indian arts.
