I am trained in the South Indian classical dance style of Bharatanatyam and have been a performer, educator, and writer for two decades. In my career as a performer, I have been invited to present at several Government and private cultural events and have conceived innovative productions that combined the Indian classical dance vocabulary with poetry, literature, myth, and cultural aesthetics. I was selected by the Rotary International as a cultural ambassador to tour Illinois and present illustrated lectures on Indian dance. In my school of Bharatanatyam, I taught students in the traditional guru-sishya parampara system and presented them in public performances. I collaborated with cultural organizations and school administrations to design and conduct interactive dance workshops in primary and secondary schools in several Indian cities. Additionally, I trained and motivated teachers and influenced and engaged with concerned school authorities to incorporate innovative art learning programs into the regular school curriculum. As a dance writer, I volunteered with print and online portals contributing columns and commentaries on Indian dance. Between 2011-2016, I ran my eZine â€“ *The Kalaparv*a which carried performance previews, reviews, travelogues, feature articles, interviews, and news feed on Indian arts.
