**SOUTH ASIAN PERFORMANCE: University of Texas, Austin: Spring 2021-WB (Web-based)**

**Course Description**

This course explored the historical evolution of South Asian performance practices such as dance, theatre, and film in India and the diaspora from the 1930s to the present. Throughout we sought to understand and question how cultural fusions and global dialogue affect traditional practices both in the native country and the diaspora, and investigated how South Asian artists navigate issues of identity, tradition, modernity, and national allegiance. Students worked with experts through workshops to experience the processes of making and staging performance. No prior knowledge of South Asia or performance was required.

I introduced students to Indian classical dance theory and a range of folk, and theatrical dances, and oral, and film performances. Focusing on the merits of indigenous Indian practices, I highlighted how performance not only perpetuated progressive ideas about Indian culture, society, and gender but was a powerful and empowering language to address issues of caste-ism, and sexism. The latter part of the semester was devoted to understanding the diasporic travel of Indian dance. Throughout the course, we watched and analyzed several historical/rare and contemporary performance videos, and read journal articles and book excerpts that borrowed from Indian dance and performance studies, postcolonial studies, and feminist theory. We had two movement workshops with experts who specialized in Kathak classical genre and Kalbeliya folk dance. In thier assignments, aside from written papers and reports, students produced innovative performance-based presentations. Most importantly, the second-generation student populace of the class, several of who trained in performing arts (Indian and others) used their papers and presentations, to argue that collegiate cultural associations, and hybridized and fusion performances were productive openings to express issues of diasporic belonging and voice social concerns. Overall, the structure helped students decipher Indian dance beyond historical stereotypes and essentialization in the West and develop cultural awareness and empathy toward the varied performance practices around them in a diasporic environment.
