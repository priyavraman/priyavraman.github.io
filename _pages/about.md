I am a scholar, performer, critic, and educator and my [research](research) focuses on South Asian performance aesthetics and criticism. In my interdisciplinary work, I integrate dance and performance studies, feminist, and postcolonial studies, as well as criticism and spectatorship theory. I particularly engage in archival study, auto-ethnography, practice-as-research methods, and qualitative analysis and interpretation. 

In my **book project**, I investigate the influence of early-twentieth-century print media on shaping discussions surrounding South Asian performance, nationhood, race, class, and gender dynamics.

My **performances** merge embodied memories of technique and cultural traditions to both revive heritage and stimulate societal conversations. 

I employ affective **performance criticism** techniques rooted in indigenous theories, fostering a decolonized approach to art spectatorship. These practices inform my pedagogy which aims to cultivate empathetic art consumers and position performance as a cultural practice.
